2
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:44,963
Hey.

3
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,502
Are you all right?

4
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:53,705
All your stuff was gone, so I thought...

5
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:54,940
I'm fine.

6
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:58,211
Well, what happened? Did
your sister do something or...

7
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:00,280
Henry, I'm leaving.

8
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,350
- What?
- I can't stay here.

9
00:01:06,018 --> 00:01:08,588
Believe me, I'm tempted.

10
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:10,456
Even though the food fuckin' sucks.

11
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:12,825
You can't. You can't.

12
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:13,893
I need your help.

13
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:15,194
- You don't.
- You're wrong.

14
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,363
I fucked up.

15
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,232
I fucked up like you have no idea,

16
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,367
and everything is worse, and I can't.

17
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,202
I can't. I can't do this on my own.

18
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:24,437
- Yes, you can.
- No.

19
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,538
You can.

20
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,374
You're stronger than you think.

21
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:36,849
Something else.

22
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:39,385
Something I need to tell you.

23
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,287
Okay.

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,756
I don't want what happened
to me to happen to you.

25
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,692
I've always wanted you to
have choice and freedom,

26
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:48,228
shit I didn't have.

27
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:51,965
I owe you that.

28
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,470
I haven't been honest
with you about everything.

29
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,574
A while ago you...

30
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,943
You asked if I knew
where your father was,

31
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:07,647
and... I said I didn't, but...

32
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:10,149
That was a lie.

33
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:17,690
Your dad is dead.

34
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,261
S... What?

35
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,865
I should have told you
before, but I couldn't.

36
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:28,401
- That's not...
- You wouldn't have listened to me,

37
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,312
and I wanted to help you,
to make things right...

38
00:02:30,336 --> 00:02:32,004
That's not... that's not possible.

39
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:33,372
It's not. It's not possible.

40
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:35,007
No, no, you don't know.

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,542
You don't know, because I...

42
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,378
I have been talking to him.

43
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,446
Like, he and I...

44
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,215
He left me a message
yesterday. He's looking for me.

45
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,160
He's been looking for me
this whole fucking time.

46
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:46,919
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,901
Dad?

48
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:05,972
Dad!

49
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,309
Simon?

50
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,514
Dad!

51
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,416
Dad!

52
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,319
Dad!

53
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:22,855
Dad, please!

54
00:03:24,357 --> 00:03:25,825
Henry.

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,408
How do you know about this place?

56
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:44,510
This is my...

57
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:47,380
this is my dad's cabin.

58
00:03:57,857 --> 00:03:58,925
No.

59
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,461
It's my cabin.

60
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:04,964
Henry...

61
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,868
I killed him.

62
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,238
It happened a long time ago,
before I even knew you existed, I...

63
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,408
No. No.

64
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:19,979
That doesn't make any sense, because...

65
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:23,782
My body has been taking me here.

66
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:26,953
I've been dreaming about him.

67
00:04:26,986 --> 00:04:29,488
We... we're connected.

68
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,692
He is here! He has to be here!

69
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:36,162
Your dad is here, in a way.

70
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,332
It's where I buried him.

71
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:50,376
No.

72
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,114
Dad?

73
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,152
Hank.

74
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,822
Oh, Hank.

75
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,391
Hey.

76
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:07,259
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

77
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:10,296
It's okay, it's okay.

78
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:12,732
Everything is gonna be okay.

79
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:30,450
Why?

80
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,751
Why?

81
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,456
Huh?

82
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,558
Why?

83
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,259
Why?

84
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,328
I did what I thought was right.

85
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:47,466
Your dad, he wasn't like us.

86
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:48,835
He wasn't a teleporter.

87
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:52,772
He was an Inactive.

88
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:56,141
And he was bitter about it.

89
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,944
He made a choice.

90
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,713
He was gonna tell whoever
would listen to him

91
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,415
about people like us.

92
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:04,417
I couldn't let that happen.

93
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,186
It was my job not to let that happen.

94
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,556
Be quiet.

95
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:12,124
Daddy?

96
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:17,062
He was dangerous.

97
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:18,840
If he would've known what
you would've become...

98
00:06:18,864 --> 00:06:20,165
No.

99
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,802
Please.

100
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:25,370
Please.

101
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:26,605
I have a family.

102
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,474
Me too.

103
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:39,318
I trusted you.

104
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,254
You're a fucking liar!

105
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,455
You're a liar!

106
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,691
Fucking liar!

107
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:50,596
You let me think...

108
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,566
You let me think he was
alive this whole time

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,169
when you knew... you knew what you did!

110
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:58,470
You knew!

111
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:09,982
You knew the whole...

112
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,528
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:24,897
I need him.

114
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:31,970
I need him.

115
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:36,241
Henry...

116
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,444
My dad...

117
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,253
You took him from me.

118
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,222
Ahhh!

119
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:56,896
Henry, I...

120
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,603
Ahh!

121
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,271
Help.

122
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:45,142
Henry...

123
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,379
Why?

124
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,814
Huh?

125
00:08:48,848 --> 00:08:51,150
What the fuck were you doing with me?

126
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:53,384
I...

127
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,188
I care about you.

128
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:04,397
Henry, Henry!

129
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:08,066
Please...

130
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,946
I'm done.

131
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,980
I told you not to call me.

132
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,185
Your brother's dead.

133
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:43,856
Henry...

134
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:47,593
He finally told you.

135
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,398
Keep this phone.

136
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,366
If you ever need anyth...

137
00:12:23,762 --> 00:12:25,564
I woke and you were gone.

138
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:27,933
I couldn't stay.

139
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,371
What I asked of you was unfair.

140
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:37,342
But I'm here now to make amends.

141
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,212
To act as a witness on your behalf.

142
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,948
This is not where you belong.

143
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:45,684
But it is.

144
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:48,086
Confessing to a crime you did not commit

145
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,455
will not provide relief
for your past sins.

146
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,924
It's not about that.

147
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:54,659
This is my path to salvation.

148
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:56,829
This is my purpose.

149
00:12:56,862 --> 00:13:00,966
What purpose can you
possibly serve from a cell?

150
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:05,905
I know you, Lucas Boone.

151
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:08,674
And you know me.

152
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,448
I care for you.

153
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,599
Job 4:15.

154
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,077
"Fear came upon me, and trembling,

155
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,113
which made all my bones to shake.

156
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,386
Then a spirit passed before my face... "

157
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,555
"And the hair of my flesh stood up.

158
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:01,092
It stood still...

159
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:03,361
but I could not discern
the form thereof:

160
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:07,433
an image was before mine eyes."

161
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,538
This is your purpose?

162
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,976
An angel?

163
00:14:19,377 --> 00:14:21,779
- I don't understand.
- I'm protecting her.

164
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:23,181
Her?

165
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:26,551
So this angel is alive?

166
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,421
She... she came to you?

167
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,058
Why would an angel want this for you?

168
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,594
She doesn't.

169
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:37,161
I came to this on my own.

170
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:39,731
Lucas, if you are here
to protect this angel,

171
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:43,202
does that mean she is the
one who killed your father?

172
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:53,545
Maybe she just lost it.

173
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:54,947
In the barn?

174
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,149
Where Nikolai dissolved
Bill Boone's body?

175
00:14:59,017 --> 00:15:01,053
What if he did something to her?

176
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:03,855
That's not possible.
Nikolai left Reston.

177
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:05,991
At least that's what Henry said.

178
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:07,393
So what does that mean?

179
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,563
- Do you think Henry could've...
- No.

180
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:15,700
- Henry would never hurt Anna.
- I don't know.

181
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,704
I mean, she convinced
Lucas to confess for her.

182
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:21,039
How do you know that?

183
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,408
Townes.

184
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:28,147
My dad...

185
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:31,183
He's dead.

186
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,852
- What?
- Henry...

187
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,187
I feel so stupid.

188
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,555
I should've known.

189
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,024
'Cause if he was alive, he
would've found me, right?

190
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,493
I mean, he would've,
like, knocked on my door,

191
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:42,560
but he couldn't.

192
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:45,264
He couldn't, because
Nikolai fucking killed him.

193
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,532
Nikolai?

194
00:15:46,565 --> 00:15:50,369
This whole time, I thought
that I was gonna see him again.

195
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:54,139
But he's been dead,
like, most of my life.

196
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,943
Henry, whose blood is that?

197
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:07,553
What else happened?

198
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,690
He killed my dad.

199
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:16,128
Look, I didn't mean to, but I
couldn't just let him, like...

200
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:20,532
He took him from me!

201
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,133
Jenna, you know.

202
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,343
You know what this feels like.

203
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,771
I mean, with your mom, like...

204
00:16:25,804 --> 00:16:29,541
I lost him, and he...
he fucking deserved it!

205
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:32,110
He deserved it!

206
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:34,580
What about Anna? What happened to her?

207
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:39,151
What?

208
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:45,457
Did you kill her too?

209
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,894
- Where did you get that?
- The barn.

210
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:52,498
Here.

211
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,233
It's fine. Just give it to me.

212
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,968
No, why? So you can destroy it?

213
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,036
No, of course not.

214
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:59,737
Where the hell is she?

215
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:01,632
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

216
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,108
- Henry, did you hurt her?
- No!

217
00:17:04,142 --> 00:17:05,878
She's not fucking dead! Sh...

218
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:10,682
I just...

219
00:17:12,484 --> 00:17:14,486
I just... I took her somewhere.

220
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:17,622
I had to!

221
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:20,559
She found out everything, and
I was... I was protecting us.

222
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,162
- Oh, my God.
- Where did you take her?

223
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:26,998
Anna's a good person.

224
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,567
She's not like Bill or Nikolai.

225
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,804
This, this is not...
heroes don't do this!

226
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:34,172
I'm gonna fix it.

227
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:36,141
- Just give me the phone.
- No.

228
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:37,910
Jenna, come on! Someone could trace it!

229
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:39,511
If Anna's okay, it doesn't matter.

230
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,045
Jenna, just...

231
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,880
- Give it to me... Jenna.
- No!

232
00:17:42,914 --> 00:17:44,182
- Let go!
- Stop it!

233
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:46,284
- Just let go!
- No!

234
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,253
- Stop it!
- You don't get it!

235
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:49,988
You don't fucking get it!

236
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:52,156
- Ah!
- You're sick!

237
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,459
Henry, there's something wrong with you!

238
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:57,062
- That's not true!
- You're a fucking monster!

239
00:17:57,095 --> 00:17:58,563
Don't fucking say that!

240
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,232
Like Nikolai!

241
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:18,216
Nikolai killed Sam too, didn't he?

242
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,820
You knew!

243
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:24,556
You knew, and you lied to me.

244
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,425
No. Please... please, just turn it off.

245
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,261
Just turn it off.

246
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,441
I believed in you.

247
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:46,778
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,649
I'm so sorry. Please...

249
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,353
Please.

250
00:18:54,386 --> 00:18:56,855
- Please, Townes.
- Get out of my room.

251
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:58,957
- Townes...
- Get out now!

252
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:07,565
I'm gonna bring her back, okay?

253
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,768
I'm gonna fix it. I
promise I'm gonna fix it.

254
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,903
I'm gonna... I'm gonna fix all of it!

255
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:37,796
Anna?

256
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:39,931
Anna?

257
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:40,966
Anna!

258
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,134
Anna!

259
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,369
Anna!

260
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:45,937
Anna!

261
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,183
Oh, shit.

262
00:19:58,216 --> 00:19:59,551
Oh, God.

263
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:04,956
Anna?

264
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:06,091
Oh, God.

265
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:36,654
Mom?

266
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,387
Shit.

267
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:11,415
Thank you.

268
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:13,451
We'll see you next week. Thank you.

269
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,186
Goodnight.

270
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:17,489
God bless. Goodnight.

271
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:19,424
Thank you.

272
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:21,460
Mrs. Boone?

273
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,036
It's Mrs. Jacobson.

274
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,505
Is there something I can help you with?

275
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:39,410
I'm concerned about your son, Lucas.

276
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,113
I fear he may be
following the wrong path.

277
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:45,550
I'm sorry. How do you know him?

278
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,520
We belong to the same church.

279
00:22:49,553 --> 00:22:51,656
I saw him this morning.

280
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:54,759
He seems consumed with
a particular young woman.

281
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,962
I'm hoping you can help me find her.

282
00:22:57,996 --> 00:23:00,699
I believe she's connected
to your ex-husband.

283
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,070
You know her...

284
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:08,515
I'm sorry, I can't help
you. I have to get back...

285
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,275
Mrs. Jacobson, please.

286
00:23:10,308 --> 00:23:12,878
Do not give up on him.

287
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:15,947
I know all too well what
it's like to lose a son.

288
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:21,085
Mine died too soon.

289
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:24,422
But death is not the
only way to lose a child.

290
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:27,859
A boy needs his mother.

291
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:31,596
Now, please...

292
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,632
who is the girl?

293
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:39,170
I don't know. I saw this place.

294
00:23:39,204 --> 00:23:41,772
It looked decent. The people were nice.

295
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:45,143
And they have egg rolls
which maybe is a sign.

296
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:48,580
Henry?

297
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,086
You all right?

298
00:23:56,988 --> 00:23:57,988
Yes, yeah.

299
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:01,526
I don't know if you noticed,
but I got some new bowls.

300
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,430
I mean, they're just plastic,
but they're nice plastic, right?

301
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:07,064
And they're ours.

302
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:12,937
You know, I was thinking,

303
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,340
like, after everything
that's happened...

304
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,611
Maybe we should just go.

305
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:21,913
- Go where?
- Anywhere.

306
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,121
I know this is a lot at once.

307
00:24:30,154 --> 00:24:31,822
But it's not the end.

308
00:24:31,856 --> 00:24:34,358
It's gonna get better. It has to.

309
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:35,727
We're just...

310
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,599
we're deep in the shit of,
like, a bad thing, and...

311
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,135
But we have each other.

312
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:46,338
And we're gonna get through it together.

313
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,171
Okay?

314
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:50,775
Okay.

315
00:24:55,045 --> 00:24:57,882
Hey, what if we have dinner in bed?

316
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,051
Dinner in bed is always better, right?

317
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,720
Come on. Come on.

318
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,256
We can pick out a movie on your laptop.

319
00:25:08,025 --> 00:25:10,762
You know, but maybe...
maybe something a little more

320
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:12,797
Romy and Michele and a little less

321
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:14,432
Requiem for a Dream.

322
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:17,002
Just saying.

323
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:20,639
Here.

324
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:31,849
Hey.

325
00:25:31,882 --> 00:25:33,718
You know I love you, right?

326
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:36,655
And I'm proud of you.

327
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,693
I love you too.

328
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:46,731
All right, let's see what we got.

329
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:52,203
This isn't me.

330
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:56,107
I mean, I don't...

331
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,409
I don't even remember writing this.

332
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,378
I thought what I turned in was...

333
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:04,816
I don't know.

334
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:07,552
Just, I want to go to college.

335
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,954
And I want to have a future, so...

336
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:13,391
please, just tell me what
to do, and I'll do it.

337
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:16,694
I'll rewrite every essay,
I'll retake every test.

338
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,163
- I'll...
- And then what?

339
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,834
What do you mean?

340
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:27,305
Are you okay?

341
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,642
Yeah.

342
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,377
Totally. I'm fine.

343
00:26:33,644 --> 00:26:37,415
I mean, no, like,
because of this, but...

344
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,853
Is there anything else going on at home?

345
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:44,021
I know what happened with Bill Boone

346
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:45,990
and your dad's girlfriend.

347
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,692
Yeah, that's o... that's okay.

348
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,460
I mean... I mean...

349
00:26:49,493 --> 00:26:51,229
it's not, but... but it is.

350
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:52,964
It's fine. I'm fine.

351
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:55,666
Just give me another chance.

352
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,435
I mean... you know me.

353
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:58,837
I'm a straight-A student.

354
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,539
I'm not this person. This isn't me.

355
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:04,375
You've said that a couple of times now.

356
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,312
Look, Jenna,

357
00:27:08,346 --> 00:27:10,982
if you keep ignoring
what's going on with you,

358
00:27:11,015 --> 00:27:12,883
that something is going on,

359
00:27:12,916 --> 00:27:16,520
then things like this
will keep happening.

360
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,990
You wrote those essays.

361
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:21,759
You failed a number of your tests.

362
00:27:21,793 --> 00:27:24,129
No one else. You.

363
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:28,866
It's okay not to be okay.

364
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,237
But ignoring it won't
make it any less real.

365
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:51,956
Hey, what's up? You need something?

366
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:58,663
Uh, the housekeeper wants
to move to Wednesdays,

367
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:00,464
so I thought we could switch your PT

368
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:03,367
so that you didn't
have to work around her.

369
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,169
Okay, cool. Whatever.

370
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,808
Uh, Mom, I'm in the middle of a game.

371
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,952
Okay.

372
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,321
What?

373
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:31,196
When I was a sophomore in
college, I dated a swimmer.

374
00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:33,031
Uh, not for long,

375
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:35,933
and "dating" is probably
too strong a word,

376
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,835
but we went out a few times.

377
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:40,839
He was older than me,
but only by a year.

378
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:43,007
Anyway, uh...

379
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,144
we... we were at a party...

380
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:50,347
one night, and we were drinking.

381
00:28:50,381 --> 00:28:51,816
But not a lot.

382
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:56,621
Um... and we ended up
in one of the rooms.

383
00:28:57,989 --> 00:29:00,324
I don't even remember how, but...

384
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:02,393
And we were kissing.

385
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:06,231
And then it got to a point where I...

386
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:07,965
tried to stop it.

387
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:11,001
Politely at first, and then...

388
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:14,005
less so, but he didn't listen.

389
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:24,148
After that, this boy
and I stopped talking.

390
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:29,887
We never talked about
how we stopped talking.

391
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,889
I would see him

392
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,692
around the campus here and there, and...

393
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,527
every time, I, uh...

394
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:44,936
You see, my generation, we didn't
talk about this sort of thing.

395
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:51,409
I knew right away how it made me feel.

396
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:54,279
It just took longer to put a word to it.

397
00:29:55,813 --> 00:29:58,283
To realize that what happened to me...

398
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:03,121
was rape.

399
00:30:05,189 --> 00:30:07,825
I've never told anybody what happened.

400
00:30:07,859 --> 00:30:09,360
Not your father.

401
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,963
Not Robert.

402
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:16,333
I don't know if I was afraid, or...

403
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:17,869
ashamed, or...

404
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:19,536
Then why are you telling me?

405
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:28,980
I think you know why.

406
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:34,152
I don't have a fucking clue, actually.

407
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,289
Then why won't you look at me?

408
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:40,458
Get the fuck out of my room.

409
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:09,287
In the end, you have to
live with what you've done.

410
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:14,192
It'll be between you and
God, and you can't escape Him.

411
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:55,599
What are you doing here?

412
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:57,035
You okay?

413
00:31:58,268 --> 00:32:00,671
Are you okay?

414
00:32:00,705 --> 00:32:02,340
Yeah, of course.

415
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,376
Jesus.

416
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,546
This is so fucked up.

417
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:15,052
I'm the one who should be in here.

418
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:17,488
Not you... I'm the one
who should be in here.

419
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:20,257
I'm gonna tell them... I'm
gonna tell them the truth.

420
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,859
I'm gonna tell them that it was me,

421
00:32:21,892 --> 00:32:23,036
and we're gonna get you out of here.

422
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,395
- Henry, no, no. No.
- Yes.

423
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,799
This is what I want.

424
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,100
And I get it, I do.

425
00:32:30,134 --> 00:32:32,570
I have been where you
are, questioning who I was,

426
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,005
believing there was no good in me,

427
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:35,515
but the very fact that
you're questioning it...

428
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,141
that means there is good in you.

429
00:32:37,175 --> 00:32:40,944
I am... I am not an angel, Lucas.

430
00:32:40,977 --> 00:32:42,213
I'm not.

431
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:44,181
I let you believe that I was

432
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,784
so that you would help me, but I am not.

433
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:50,054
I am a bad and selfish person.

434
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:51,589
Hey. Hey, hey.

435
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,660
You are not.

436
00:32:57,027 --> 00:32:59,296
You're not.

437
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,966
What, you think all angels
are perfect and shit?

438
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,969
You gotta read the Bible,
because that's not what they are,

439
00:33:05,002 --> 00:33:06,838
and that is not who I think you are.

440
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:09,340
I'm not that fuckin' crazy, Henry.

441
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:10,575
I'm not.

442
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:13,777
I killed your father.

443
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,447
You also walked through
fire without getting burned.

444
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:17,682
Jesus Christ.

445
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:22,720
- Sorry, I'm just...
- I know. I know.

446
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,388
It's a lot to take in.

447
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:28,325
I...

448
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:31,161
I don't... I don't know
what you want from me.

449
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:33,230
I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

450
00:33:33,264 --> 00:33:35,299
Could you please...

451
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,969
Look, it took me getting away from here

452
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:40,738
and all my family shit

453
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:42,206
to finally see clearly,

454
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:44,942
to see what I was meant
for, but I know it now.

455
00:33:44,975 --> 00:33:47,612
I fuckin' know it right in here.

456
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:50,514
And I've got faith

457
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:55,086
that if you can just
clear all this noise...

458
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,121
that you'll know too.

459
00:33:57,154 --> 00:34:00,925
The Lord will open a
path for you, Henry.

460
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:05,329
But you gotta open your eyes to see.

461
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:12,670
You shouldn't be here.

462
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,776
You gotta go.

463
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,177
- Okay?
- Lucas.

464
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,545
Wait. Come on.

465
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:23,414
Hey. Just...

466
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:28,853
Remember that doing what's right...

467
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:32,956
Isn't always what's easy.

468
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:48,839
Hey.

469
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,709
That was a really long meeting.

470
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:56,280
Yeah, I've... I've been
driving around for a while.

471
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,085
Okay, so? How did it go?

472
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,654
Did you guys come up with a plan?

473
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,656
You gonna get your grades back up?

474
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:10,561
We mostly just talked about me.

475
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:13,964
Cool.

476
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:14,999
Okay. Got it.

477
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:19,936
That's it?

478
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:21,939
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

479
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,740
More than that.

480
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,876
Come on, Jenna, I...

481
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:28,645
It feels like I can't
win with you. You...

482
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,614
I'm trying to make things right.

483
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm trying to put you first,
try to get you out of this mess,

484
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,886
- get you back to your old self...
- What does that mean?

485
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:39,724
I don't know. I don't... ah...

486
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:42,559
- I'm just talking.
- No, you do know.

487
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:44,495
You're just not saying it.

488
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:47,230
That... I can't keep
doing this with you.

489
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:50,000
- You make it so hard.
- How do I make it hard?

490
00:35:50,034 --> 00:35:51,035
You're afraid.

491
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:54,872
You're afraid to talk about Mom.

492
00:35:54,905 --> 00:36:00,143
You're afraid to get mad and,
like, actually feel things,

493
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,780
and you're afraid to know who I am.

494
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:04,848
Like, really know me.

495
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:06,951
That's not true. Not true.

496
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,319
Aren't you still trying
to figure out who you are?

497
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:11,221
I mean, you're just 17.

498
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:17,627
Right.

499
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:38,648
- Look who I found.
- Mom, you have to knock.

500
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:39,750
Hi.

501
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:41,819
I like your room.

502
00:36:41,852 --> 00:36:43,387
It's bigger in person.

503
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,690
It's larger than Megan's room too.

504
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:47,958
Mom?

505
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:49,560
Some privacy?

506
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,394
Oh, yes.

507
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:53,396
Sorry. Of course.

508
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,432
But game night starts in ten,

509
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,601
and we don't hold your
spot if you're late.

510
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,436
I'm just kidding.

511
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,671
I... That's a joke.

512
00:37:01,705 --> 00:37:03,007
Ah.

513
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,675
But seriously, ten minutes.

514
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,311
Your father and I
will shuffle the board.

515
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,353
I have something important to tell you.

516
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:18,932
Is it about the allergens here?
Because your mom already said that...

517
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:21,792
Nope, it's actually highly
sensitive information.

518
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:25,796
But I need your permission
before I say more,

519
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:29,366
because I don't want to
burden you with my problems

520
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,468
unless you want to be burdened.

521
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:32,970
I love you, Townes.

522
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,038
Whatever you need,

523
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:36,974
whatever's going on,

524
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,141
I'm in.

525
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,410
All right.

526
00:37:40,811 --> 00:37:41,811
So...

527
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:47,752
For some time now, I've been
acting as a sidekick to a superhero.

528
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:50,720
- Oh.
- I know.

529
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:53,924
It's been very exciting, but...

530
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:59,229
Then something terrible happened.

531
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:01,999
Really terrible, and...

532
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:06,136
now I think maybe I've
actually been a henchman,

533
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,540
serving not a hero but a villain.

534
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,943
I... I don't know what I am or...

535
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:14,845
or who I'm meant to be.

536
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,482
All I know is, I need to
try and make things right.

537
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:22,987
Lives are on the line.

538
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:25,489
- Okay.
- And...

539
00:38:25,522 --> 00:38:28,058
I want you to be my partner.

540
00:38:28,091 --> 00:38:29,793
Not a sidekick.

541
00:38:29,826 --> 00:38:33,063
But my equal in this fight,

542
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:34,498
if there is a fight.

543
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:38,135
But hopefully there's not, and if
there is, it's nothing too physical.

544
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:40,004
Um, yeah, I hope so too.

545
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,038
Yeah.

546
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:45,975
Well, good, great.

547
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:47,077
Thank you.

548
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,879
Mm.

549
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,847
I love you too, by the way.

550
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:53,217
I forgot to say it before.

551
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,786
Okay, there's a lot to explain,

552
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,756
but our first mission is time-sensitive.

553
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:01,625
I need you to help me find someone.

554
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,696
She could be anywhere in the world.

555
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,046
Dad's gone?

556
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:02,653
I'm sorry.

557
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:07,558
I'm so sorry for everything.

558
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,529
I think I let you down.

559
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:15,866
I know that this isn't what you wanted.

560
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,370
This isn't who you wanted to be.

561
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:20,704
And I'm just...

562
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,809
I just don't know what to do anymore.

563
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:30,648
What do I do?

564
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:35,619
Keep Mom safe.

565
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,658
I did.

566
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,295
I am. I mean...

567
00:40:44,328 --> 00:40:46,797
Everyone that could hurt her is gone.

568
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:49,700
Maybe it's time to go.

569
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:55,839
I can't.

570
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,608
She needs us.

571
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,810
And I would come back to her.

572
00:41:00,844 --> 00:41:03,347
I always come back to her.

573
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:05,883
Not if you break it.

574
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,588
But I...

575
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,161
And how would I do that
without hurting her?

576
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:45,855
Megan? It's Jenna.

577
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,624
Jenna? Hi! How's it going?

578
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:49,326
It's good.

579
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,528
- I'm good.
- Well, what's up?

580
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:54,230
Well, actually I was...

581
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,467
calling to...

582
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,669
see if you had Kate's number.

583
00:41:59,703 --> 00:42:02,138
I... I hung out with
her at Darcy's party,

584
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:04,307
and I kinda...

585
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:06,609
you know, I... I didn't
get to say goodbye.

586
00:42:10,013 --> 00:42:11,982
- Wait, she said that?
- Yeah!

587
00:42:12,782 --> 00:42:15,518
Great.

588
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:17,154
That's great.

589
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,889
So do you think you
could text me her number?

590
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:25,796
Thanks. Okay, I'll talk to you later.

591
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:54,758
Hey.

592
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,828
Where've you been?

593
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:01,398
You okay, honey?

594
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:03,167
What's wrong?

595
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,203
My dad's dead.

596
00:43:07,403 --> 00:43:09,473
- What?
- Simon is dead.

597
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:11,742
Are you sure?

598
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:16,346
I don't understand.

599
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:22,452
When did he...

600
00:43:22,485 --> 00:43:24,955
He didn't abandon us, Mom.

601
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:26,389
He didn't want to leave.

602
00:43:26,423 --> 00:43:28,025
He just didn't have a choice.

603
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,329
How do you know all this?

604
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:36,131
Baby?

605
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:39,970
Henry?

606
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,281
Why didn't you know?

607
00:43:53,283 --> 00:43:55,819
Why am I the one who
had to figure it out?

608
00:43:57,087 --> 00:43:59,689
I've asked you about him

609
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,659
so many times, and you just wouldn't...

610
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:03,793
you didn't care.

611
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:05,062
Honey, that's not true.

612
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:07,664
You let me think he
didn't want to know me.

613
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,533
But he did.

614
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:11,802
He loved me. He loved us.

615
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:15,071
And if you gave a shit about me,

616
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:18,441
or... or him or anyone but yourself,

617
00:44:18,475 --> 00:44:20,109
you would've tried.

618
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:21,711
You would've fucking tried, Mom.

619
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,380
Can you give me a second?

620
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,959
'Cause you just dropped all of this
on me, and I'm trying to unders...

621
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,417
- No.
- Henry, I...

622
00:44:27,451 --> 00:44:30,920
No! I have spent my entire
fucking life giving you a second,

623
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:33,156
picking up after you,
taking care of you,

624
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:35,892
making sure you have
everything that you need!

625
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:37,160
Okay, that's not true.

626
00:44:37,193 --> 00:44:39,862
"Oh, honey, isn't this place great?

627
00:44:39,896 --> 00:44:41,731
Don't you think he's nice?

628
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,900
Henry, this time it's
gonna be different.

629
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:46,603
Just you wait. Just you fucking wait!"

630
00:44:46,636 --> 00:44:49,273
I am so sick of it, Mom!

631
00:44:50,206 --> 00:44:52,375
How many schools have
you pulled me out of?

632
00:44:52,409 --> 00:44:55,845
How many... how many
places have we lived?

633
00:44:55,879 --> 00:44:57,313
You're always worrying about me.

634
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,024
Wondering why I don't
have fucking friends.

635
00:44:59,048 --> 00:45:00,984
Why do you think I don't
have fucking friends?!

636
00:45:01,017 --> 00:45:02,952
Do you think that this is fun for me?

637
00:45:02,986 --> 00:45:04,954
Do you think that I like
moving around so much?

638
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:06,989
- I don't think that.
- Huh?

639
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:09,192
Just you and me on
another fucking adventure?

640
00:45:09,226 --> 00:45:10,393
I'm sorry, okay?

641
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:11,795
You're right.

642
00:45:11,828 --> 00:45:13,730
You're totally right.

643
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:15,999
I'm sorry, Henry.

644
00:45:16,866 --> 00:45:19,136
I've been so selfish, honey.

645
00:45:19,169 --> 00:45:21,405
And I knew that it hurt you.

646
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,540
Deep down I knew that.

647
00:45:23,573 --> 00:45:26,343
I knew that it was hurting
you, and I did it anyway.

648
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,078
I'm really sorry.

649
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:34,884
It's too late.

650
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,753
No, it's not too late, honey.

651
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:38,922
I'm doing better. I'm
trying to do better.

652
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:41,091
I mean, you know that.

653
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:46,229
This is you trying?

654
00:45:46,262 --> 00:45:48,632
I mean, this is a start, Henry.

655
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,101
You think because you
rented this fucking apartment

656
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:53,270
and you bought fucking bowls

657
00:45:53,303 --> 00:45:55,671
that everything's gonna be okay?

658
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:57,040
Why?

659
00:45:57,073 --> 00:45:59,843
Because we have each other?

660
00:45:59,876 --> 00:46:02,379
Well, it's not, because
I don't want you.

661
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:04,280
I'm sorry that this isn't good enough.

662
00:46:04,313 --> 00:46:06,549
I'm sorry that I can't give you more.

663
00:46:06,582 --> 00:46:09,352
How many times do you
want me to apologize?

664
00:46:09,386 --> 00:46:12,089
How many? I don't know
what the fuck you want.

665
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:15,100
I want you to be better than you are.

666
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:16,926
Oh, okay. That's all?

667
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,396
- That's all you want?
- I can't keep doing this.

668
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:22,132
I can't... can't be everything to you.

669
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:24,834
What are you doing? I don't even...

670
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,269
will you stop being so dramatic?

671
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:27,637
I don't want to end up like you.

672
00:46:27,671 --> 00:46:29,639
I don't want you to end
up like me either, okay?

673
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:31,608
I want you to have a better life.

674
00:46:31,641 --> 00:46:33,410
Then let me go.

675
00:46:33,443 --> 00:46:34,911
What? No. Henry, stop.

676
00:46:34,944 --> 00:46:36,050
Please, will you stop?
Will you look at me?

677
00:46:36,051 --> 00:46:38,315
Will you fucking look at me?

678
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:42,953
Be honest with me.

679
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:47,023
Have you ever loved
anyone that you've dated?

680
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:49,392
Or were you just looking
for a free place to stay?

681
00:46:49,426 --> 00:46:50,627
Excuse me?

682
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,029
Thomas is the only nice guy
that you have ever been with,

683
00:46:53,062 --> 00:46:54,597
and you fucked that up too.

684
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:55,799
Want to know what I think?

685
00:46:55,832 --> 00:46:58,168
I think you're just a fucking sad,

686
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:00,871
lonely woman, and no one
is ever going to love you!

687
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:02,038
What the fuck, Henry?

688
00:47:02,072 --> 00:47:03,349
You think you deserve better than this,

689
00:47:03,373 --> 00:47:05,141
but you don't, and you never will!

690
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:07,177
I see the way that you are.

691
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:10,280
Pining for men's attention,
asking them for help,

692
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:11,614
acting weak.

693
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:15,218
It's probably why I asked Clay
for help in the first place.

694
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:17,587
It's why I ended up in that truck.

695
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,021
And it's why he raped me.

696
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:21,357
- What?
- It's your fault.

697
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,259
What he did to me is because of you.

698
00:47:23,292 --> 00:47:25,028
No, no. That is not my fault.

699
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:27,564
That is not your fault.
That is Clay Boone's fault.

700
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:29,742
Everything bad that's ever
happened to me is because of you.

701
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:32,102
- No, that is not...
- Admit it!

702
00:47:32,135 --> 00:47:33,436
- Stop it, stop it!
- Mom...

703
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:36,172
- You have to st...
- I don't need you anymore!

704
00:47:36,205 --> 00:47:39,008
I don't... not like you need
me, and I bet that kills you.

705
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,910
- No, it doesn't.
- Doesn't it?

706
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:42,245
Prove it!

707
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:44,280
Prove that you're not weak,
that you don't need me!

708
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:45,782
Get out of my fucking face. Stop it!

709
00:47:45,815 --> 00:47:46,883
Or what?

710
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,260
- You need to calm down!
- Admit it!

711
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:49,495
- I don't need you!
- Calm down!

712
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:50,687
Say it! Come on!

713
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,821
- Enough!
- Let me go!

714
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:52,856
Ow!

715
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:54,024
Fuck!

716
00:47:56,325 --> 00:47:57,961
All right, get out! Get the fuck out!

717
00:47:57,994 --> 00:48:00,330
Go! Get the fuck out!

718
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,546
I never want to see you again.

719
00:48:18,915 --> 00:48:20,450
Henry...

720
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,580
I don't... I can't...

721
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:26,015
You should've seen him.

722
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,117
He wasn't even remorseful.

723
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:29,552
It's okay.

724
00:49:29,585 --> 00:49:32,122
- We'll figure it out.
- How?

725
00:49:32,155 --> 00:49:33,824
What is there to figure out?

726
00:49:33,857 --> 00:49:36,025
I know he did it.

727
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,259
He's a rapist.

728
00:49:37,293 --> 00:49:39,229
He is your son.

729
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:41,465
I don't even know how to be around him.

730
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,708

I've been watching you for some time.

747
00:54:16,806 --> 00:54:18,007
It was you.

748
00:54:19,742 --> 00:54:23,380
You have no idea what you've started.
