﻿1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,854
Previously on Genius...

2
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:08,356
Olga Khokhlova.

3
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:09,857
Russian aristocracy.

4
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:12,260
She must be looking for
the Duke or Viscount.

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,895
I cannot let you in.

6
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:15,229
We are not married.

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,999
She certainly has
you under her spell.

8
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,668
You're a married man,
with a reputation to protect.

9
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,120
You spend your
days with your snob of

10
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,744
a wife pretending you
are an aristocrat.

11
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,443
At least I have not
abandoned my friends.

12
00:00:29,812 --> 00:00:32,613
I am the only Madam Picasso.

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:35,550
Hey, Olga!

14
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,885
Someday I'm going to
paint the perfect painting.

15
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,420
I had no idea
you were so talented.

16
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,723
Kahnweiler's been
asking me for new works to

17
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:42,924
show, and I just...

18
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,392
Don't have the time anymore...

19
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:45,626
Go on.

20
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:47,195
Play the game you played
the night we first met.

21
00:00:47,196 --> 00:00:48,997
Even when you missed,
you didn't flinch.

22
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:51,099
She is so happy
when you are here, Pablo.

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,503
Do you think Maya wants
to watch me cuddling Paloma?

24
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:56,170
Maya loves Paloma.

25
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:58,673
And how long do
you plan to keep me waiting?

26
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,441
It did not occur
to me that you were interested

27
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:01,609
in an old man.

28
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,277
You don't seem old to me.

29
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:04,779
Clear!

30
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,447
I don't understand why
you let these women hang on.

31
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:07,648
I should leave you.

32
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:11,309
Ridiculous!
Nobody leaves Picasso!

00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,990
My hand in your
hair will sow the stars of

35
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,659
sapphire, pearl, ruby...

36
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,797
that you never be deaf to my desire...

37
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:35,236
my oasis and my gourd whence I aspire.

38
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,008
Your writing is exquisite.

39
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:45,813
It's not me. It's Baudelaire.

40
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:48,015
You're absurdly romantic, Paul.

41
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:52,487
And you, you don't have a
romantic bone in your body, do you, hm?

42
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,756
To you, it's just
photography, politics and sex.

43
00:02:56,658 --> 00:02:58,593
Sex is just a game.

44
00:02:58,594 --> 00:03:00,995
Lately, it bores the hell out of me.

45
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,030
All these great
men you've bedded,

46
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:05,399
not one of them has managed
to get his claws into you?

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,634
God no.

48
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,702
I get tired of them
in a matter of weeks.

49
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,843
You've never been in love?

50
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,149
Paul...

51
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,214
I can barely tolerate romantic.

52
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:23,417
I absolutely despise sentimental.

53
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:27,889
Dora, uh, love is the
most creative force in nature.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,091
What you need is an Amour Fou.

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,861
A mad love?

56
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,429
No thank you.

57
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,232
It's what inspires
true artists like us.

58
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,468
You don't have
to explain it to me.

59
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,237
I understand the Surrealist
dogma as well as anyone.

60
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,674
A magical love, born
of a chance encounter.

61
00:03:47,342 --> 00:03:51,412
'Fate.' Frankly, I think it's
a ridiculous superstition.

62
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,786
You are a goddess, Dora.

63
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:02,857
What you need is a God.

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,595
Do you have someone in mind?

65
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,669
Oh!
Gorillas are chasing us. Yeah!

66
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,407
Pablo, stop that!

67
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,142
What, what?

68
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:23,133
You're embarrassing yourself.
Have you no sense of decorum?

69
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,613
Oh. Andre, Paul!

70
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,415
You've come just in time.

71
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:33,087
Ah, oh, uh, Andre Breton
and, uh, Paul Éluard.

72
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:36,790
My wife. Olga Khokhlova.

73
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,327
It seems you forgot to
mention to your friends that

74
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,028
this is a formal occasion.

75
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,764
For God's sake, Olga,
who cares how they are dressed?

76
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,600
If you want to entertain adults,

77
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,768
you should learn to act like one.

78
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,137
Let's go to my studio.

79
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,473
It's the only place
she can't torture me.

80
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,753
"I am not a gentleman."

81
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:08,522
That is exactly why
you are our hero, Pablo.

82
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,094
It's intuitive, automatic.

83
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,929
Emanations from the subconscious.

84
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,231
Charged with eroticism,

85
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:20,701
born from the chance
juxtaposition of images.

86
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:23,470
This painting is everything
I've been writing about.

87
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:26,340
It's a masterpiece of Surrealism.

88
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:29,677
Andre has just finished
a collection of essays,

89
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:31,879
Surrealism and Painting.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,782
We would be honored
if you would endorse it.

91
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,317
Maybe come to our next meeting?

92
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:39,086
I don't want to be labeled.

93
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:42,456
Surrealist, Cubist and Modernist.

94
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:45,192
What is next? Communist?

95
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:47,962
The Communists are
going to remake the world.

96
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,316
Besides, my work
lately is nothing but anger.

97
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,037
Bitterness.

98
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,972
No one wants to see that, really.

99
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:59,407
That's absurd.

100
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,475
You're the most important
painter in France.

101
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,645
I am stuck in a
golden cage with a woman who

102
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,515
cares more about chandeliers
and Persian carpets than

103
00:06:07,516 --> 00:06:10,484
anything I will ever paint.

104
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,020
I should have known better
than to ever get married.

105
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,958
I need someone new...

106
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:55,296
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

107
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:56,764
Uh, yes?

108
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:59,933
Um, you have
an extraordinary face.

109
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:01,736
I beg your pardon?

110
00:07:01,737 --> 00:07:04,572
It was fate that you walked by.

111
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,440
Oh, what do you mean?

112
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,310
I want to paint you.

113
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,214
Oh, I,
I don't think so, Monsieur.

114
00:07:13,215 --> 00:07:15,249
I am Picasso.

115
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,651
I'm sorry, what?

116
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,253
You have never heard of me?

117
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:20,921
No.

118
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,623
Should I have?

119
00:07:22,624 --> 00:07:25,125
Um...

120
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:30,397
Recognize him?

121
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,299
You're famous.

122
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,468
In certain circles.

123
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:37,972
Now would you let me paint you?

124
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:40,307
Why would you want to?

125
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,010
My sisters call me an ugly duck.

126
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:45,179
Oh, that's absurd.

127
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,081
They're jealous.

128
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:50,617
Let me show you how I see you.

129
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,122
My studio is just
two blocks from here.

130
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:02,796
Only for a few
minutes, I have to get home.

131
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:23,350
You, your sisters
couldn't be more wrong about you.

132
00:08:24,252 --> 00:08:26,620
You are magnificent.

133
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,024
Like a Roman statue.

134
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:35,429
That's a very special book.

135
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,799
Go ahead, take a look at it.

136
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,509
120 Days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade.

137
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:51,812
Have you heard of it?

138
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:55,983
Marquis de Sade destroyed
old-fashioned literature the

139
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:59,753
same way I have
destroyed the rules of old

140
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:02,055
masters of painting.

141
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:19,907
"Bestowing heartfelt kisses
on my mouth and eyes, he said,

142
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:22,743
'If I am to teach
you what to do in order

143
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:26,513
to give me pleasure,

144
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:30,584
'tis only fair that at
the same time I teach you

145
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:34,288
what to do in order to receive it.'

146
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:44,317
He then placed his hand upon my..."

147
00:09:58,046 --> 00:10:00,514
I don't want to make you late.

148
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:04,952
Why don't you come back
and see me again tomorrow?

149
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,755
I still live with my mother.

150
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:11,158
She, she might not approve.

151
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,429
You seem
like an intelligent girl.

152
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:19,099
I am sure you can think
of something to tell her.

153
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:24,137
If you want to come, be
here at 3:00 in the afternoon.

154
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,041
Precisely.

155
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,121
Where have you been?

156
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:42,456
I'm sorry...

157
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:43,724
I went shopping and then...

158
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:46,426
I, um, I played tennis with Nicoline.

159
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,730
In those clothes?

160
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:52,666
Tell me the truth.

161
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:53,934
I met someone...

162
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,202
Who?

163
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:56,670
An artist.

164
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,439
He wants to do my portrait.

165
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,141
He's probably
trying to get you into bed.

166
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:03,510
For all you know, he's not
really an artist at all.

167
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:06,680
Oh, I-I think
he's quite successful, actually.

168
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:09,817
His name is Picasso.

169
00:11:09,818 --> 00:11:12,786
Picasso?

170
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:16,657
By all means, let him paint you.

171
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,506
You're late.

172
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,541
I'm sorry, Monsieur Picasso.

173
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:38,378
And you must call me Pablo.

174
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:43,183
I promise
to always be on time...

175
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,485
Pablo.

176
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:57,230
Don't be shy.
You can look at it again.

177
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:16,383
Read out loud.

178
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:25,626
"She had very handsome eyes,

179
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:29,697
exceedingly fair skin,
and one of the most splendid

180
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,199
and plumpest..."

181
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:36,570
Are you a virgin?

182
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:39,573
Yes.

183
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:48,048
Then I will be your first.

184
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:54,788
Shh, don't laugh.

185
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:25,319
It's Amour Fou...

186
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,987
This girl, Geneviève.

187
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:30,424
She's so young and vibrant and...

188
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,827
It's different this time, Paul.

189
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:38,799
All my romantic adventures
have been ruined by friction

190
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,185
and-and suffering; two
bodies coiled in barbed wire,

191
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:47,703
you know, chafing against each
other, tearing their flesh.

192
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:53,066
But with this one, it's been
all sweetness and honey.

193
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:57,617
She's a hive without bees.

194
00:13:57,886 --> 00:13:59,831
She must be very good in bed to

195
00:13:59,844 --> 00:14:01,934
elicit such poetry from
the great Picasso.

196
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:06,293
She makes me feel alive.

197
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:08,228
And Françoise doesn't?

198
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:11,698
She looks at me like I am old.

199
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,001
Anyway, I have a favor to ask you.

200
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,304
Of course, anything.

201
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:20,107
I have to sneak all the way
to Paris when I want to see her.

202
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,011
I need a place closer.

203
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,746
St. Tropez would be perfect.

204
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,416
I'll see what I can do.

205
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:30,717
Yes...

206
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,886
A flat, a house, a castle?

207
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:42,329
Thanks for helping
me watch the children, Kostas.

208
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,066
Well, maybe they
should take naps and we could

209
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,768
have some sangria.

210
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:49,369
Sangria?

211
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,039
You've been spending too much
time with Pablo's nephews.

212
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,441
Actually, I don't
like the way Javier makes it.

213
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,910
No, we do it better in Greece.

214
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,112
Didn't you have
a dissertation to finish?

215
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:02,049
I could go
back to Paris tomorrow.

216
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,551
All day long it's
mama this, mama that.

217
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,186
You need a little adult time.

218
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,222
Oh, I wish I could,
but when Pablo comes home...

219
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:11,725
I have a third child to look after.

220
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,761
Where is he anyway?

221
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:18,532
We barely
ever see him these days.

222
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:22,235
He's always dashing off
to Paris or St. Tropez.

223
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:27,140
The children miss him.

224
00:15:27,141 --> 00:15:30,310
What about you?

225
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:35,165
You're right, Kostas.
The children need their nap.

226
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:39,419
And you need to get on a train.

227
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,696
Daniel...

228
00:15:49,697 --> 00:15:55,645
Uh, it's very nice to see you,
I'm sorry, Pablo isn't here.

229
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,572
Well, that's
my good fortune then.

230
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,608
It gives me some time to see
what you've been working on.

231
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:04,645
Well, I'm afraid I don't
have anything new to show you.

232
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:08,415
I've been too busy with the children.

233
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,950
That's a shame.

234
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,185
I've been getting a marvelous
response to your paintings.

235
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:13,654
You're just being kind.

236
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,088
No, not at all.

237
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:16,823
I've sold three pieces
this month and...

238
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:19,159
do you know Janine Charrat?

239
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,994
The choreographer?

240
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:25,732
She's looking for a
designer for her new ballet in Paris.

241
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:29,336
I told her you would be perfect.

242
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:34,007
I've never designed
a set or a costume in my life.

243
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,611
Neither had
Pablo when he did Parade.

244
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,847
She loves your work, Françoise.

245
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:47,287
God that sounds like fun.

246
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,222
It's impossible.

247
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:51,158
How can you go to
Paris for weeks on end?

248
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,661
Who's going to take
care of the children?

249
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:58,832
Well, they have a father.

250
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,169
You know I cannot
look after them night and day.

251
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:08,808
I wouldn't get any work done.

252
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,264
Open the door
before I break it down!

253
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,401
What in God's name do you want?

254
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,590
You must get dressed.
We're going

255
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:35,836
to be late for dinner
with the Beaumonts.

256
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:38,806
No, you go without me.
I'm working.

257
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,041
You're always working.

258
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,709
You are never home
and when you are home,

259
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,977
you lock yourself in here.

260
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,145
Well, why wouldn't I?

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,815
All you ever do is complain.

262
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,085
Please, Olga, I'm working. Please.

263
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,330
Don't you ever
get tired of painting me?

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,401
Your face, in this light?

265
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,336
How could I ever get tired of that?

266
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:12,573
I'm glad
you still feel that way.

267
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,475
Now go and get cleaned up.

268
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:17,478
I have a surprise for you.

269
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,315
Do you?

270
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:24,852
I bought us
tickets to see Josephine Baker.

271
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:33,491
Yeah, well
it's a, it's a popular play.

272
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:42,207
We might run into someone who knows
Olga and what would I say to them?

273
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,607
So even after all these years,

274
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:49,743
this little flat will be the only
place we can ever be together?

275
00:18:53,014 --> 00:18:58,152
Pablo, when are you
going to divorce her?

276
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,688
You promised me.

277
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,673
You know I would like nothing

278
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,572
better than to be
free from that woman.

279
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:11,331
But, but divorce is very complicated.

280
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,538
I love you...

281
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,742
but for now we need to
keep things as they are.

282
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:28,601
If Olga found out about you,
she would make life hell.

283
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,619
It's heaven...

284
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,554
Our own secret little Shangri-La.

285
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:36,623
Yes, I thought it was
a rather romantic little flat.

286
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,492
I'm delighted you like it.

287
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,794
We love it.

288
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,162
Thank you so much, Paul.

289
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,819
- I owe you one favor, my friend.
- Oh.

290
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,443
Monsieur Picasso, a-a few
questions for my readers, please.

291
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,744
Oh, not now.

292
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:48,212
Who's your pretty friend,
a new muse perhaps?

293
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,048
Get out of here,
before I break that thing.

294
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:55,753
Ah, Mademoiselle
Gilot, how may I help you?

295
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,389
I've come to collect
Monsieur Picasso's pieces.

296
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,658
I'm sorry,
they have not been fired yet.

297
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,929
But they should be ready by the
time he returns from St. Tropez.

298
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,532
He's in Paris, actually.

299
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,933
Oh, well.

300
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,969
The papers must be mistaken.

301
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,539
Mistaken about what?

302
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,809
I'm sure
it's just silly gossip...

303
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,911
What kind of gossip?

304
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:23,648
Well, if you must know...

305
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,680
they say he has been seen there in the

306
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:27,563
company of a striking young lady.

307
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,870
Ah, what are these? Costumes?

308
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:50,241
Mm.

309
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:52,610
I've accepted the
position with the ballet.

310
00:20:52,611 --> 00:20:55,646
I'm leaving for Paris next week.

311
00:20:57,082 --> 00:21:00,551
But I told you it,
it was not possible.

312
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:09,894
Well, if you can do
whatever you want, so can I.

313
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,263
Do what I want?

314
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,965
Uh-huh.

315
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,438
What are you talking about?

316
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,673
Your new girlfriend...

317
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:25,342
in St. Tropez.

318
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,380
How can you listen
to such ridiculous rumors?

319
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,116
There is no girlfriend.

320
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:35,186
Don't lie to me, Pablo.

321
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,688
After everything we've been through,

322
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:39,390
the one thing I've always
counted on is that we always

323
00:21:39,391 --> 00:21:42,493
tell each other the truth.

324
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:52,303
Well, I, I am telling the truth.

325
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:56,641
And if I was with another woman,

326
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:58,409
it would be your own fault.

327
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,579
When was the last time you
showed me any affection?

328
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:05,650
That's hard to
do when you're never here.

329
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:10,154
Oh, I see. You're punishing me.

330
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:15,626
No. No, I'm rewarding myself.

331
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:18,495
Oh.

332
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,765
For all the
sacrifices I've made to your

333
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:22,333
art at the expense of my own.

334
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,835
It's my turn, Pablo.

335
00:22:24,836 --> 00:22:27,805
My God, you are made of ice.

336
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:31,042
How else could a mother
just abandon her children?

337
00:22:31,043 --> 00:22:32,677
I'm not abandoning my children.

338
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:35,913
I've spoken to Maya, she's
gonna come and watch them.

339
00:22:35,914 --> 00:22:37,415
I'm only going away for two months.

340
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,917
They can visit me on weekends.

341
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:29,500
Who is she?

342
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,770
You've painted her
over and over again.

343
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:38,943
She's nobody,
just, just a model.

344
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:41,012
I won't be made a fool of.

345
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:43,180
I gave up everything for you.

346
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,482
My career, my country, my body.

347
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,452
I won't have myself and my child
humiliated by some harlot.

348
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:51,789
Humiliated?

349
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,758
You live like a Russian princess.

350
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,593
Get rid of her.

351
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:03,434
Marie-Thérèse.

352
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,206
What is it?

353
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:11,976
I know it's complicated,

354
00:24:11,977 --> 00:24:13,377
but we must get married.

355
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:14,879
We have discussed this.

356
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,281
You know how difficult
that is and especially now,

357
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:18,683
Olga is just...

358
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:21,352
Pablo...

359
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:25,189
I'm pregnant.

360
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:53,484
Did you tell her it's over?

361
00:24:56,054 --> 00:24:59,123
I want a divorce.

362
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,408
It was a, a wedding gift.

363
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,011
I never liked it, she can have it.

364
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,818
I'm told there's a second floor?

365
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,319
Yeah, but that's my studio.

366
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,888
Everything there belongs to me.

367
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,424
Monsieur Picasso,
"one half of all possessions"

368
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:27,893
includes any artwork that you own.

369
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:31,696
Um, But I painted them.

370
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:35,667
I'm afraid
the law is quite clear.

371
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,775
The divorce is off.

372
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,911
So you are
getting rid of the girl?

373
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:46,945
No.

374
00:25:46,946 --> 00:25:47,756
Then what?

375
00:25:47,757 --> 00:25:49,340
I am not going to let you get

376
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,049
away with half of my life's work.

377
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,584
I see...

378
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,586
God forbid you should lose any
of your precious paintings.

379
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:56,121
They mean more to you than people do.

380
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,090
Oh, I know you, Olga.

381
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:00,692
You would only sell them
to buy shoes and fur coats.

382
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,260
Do what you wish.

383
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:05,097
But I refuse to be humiliated
when the papers discover you

384
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:07,733
are having a baby with
your filthy mistress.

385
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,068
Paulo and I are moving
to the Hotel California.

386
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,837
At your expense...

387
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,007
I hope you and your new
family are very happy...

388
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,889
Thank you for
taking such good care of me

389
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,558
and little Maya.

390
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:38,029
Oh, of course,
you're my two girls.

391
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,350
Marie-Thérèse...

392
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,452
Marie-Thérèse...

393
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:02,754
The doctor said it's okay.

394
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:05,023
It's been two months.

395
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,660
We have plenty of time
while the baby's asleep.

396
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:12,497
Yes...

397
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:18,636
Is, is something wrong?

398
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:31,249
I haven't painted anything
since I have been living here.

399
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,720
I need to go back to my studio.

400
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,889
I thought
you loved the light here.

401
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,962
Yes, yes, I,
I, yes, but it's, uh...

402
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:49,501
different now.

403
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,137
It's not me, is it, Pablo?

404
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:55,340
I, I still inspire you, don't I?

405
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,676
No, no, no,
no, you, you mean the,

406
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,381
you mean the world to me...

407
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:08,653
It's just, uh, too
many distractions here.

408
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:14,259
I need to go back to my studio.

409
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,828
I have to.

410
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,264
Hey.

411
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,899
Dear Maya.

412
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,035
Papa will come see you
and Mama very soon.

413
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:31,543
You are an angel, Maya.
How many stories did it take?

414
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,880
Four, but
they're finally asleep.

415
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:44,377
Well, I don't know
what I would do without you.

416
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,693
You're a wonderful big sister.

417
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,929
They're wonderful children.

418
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,532
Obviously, Françoise
is a very good mother.

419
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,237
Good mother?

420
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,706
No, we have barely heard from her.

421
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,042
I'm sure she's quite
busy with the ballet.

422
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,411
Yeah, but her real
responsibilities are here.

423
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,380
She's taking advantage
of your kindness.

424
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,748
No, don't be silly.

425
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,049
I'm glad to help.

426
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,817
I want her to be able
to pursue her work,

427
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,219
just like you do, Papa.

428
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,455
But she can work here.
Nobody's stopping her.

429
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,791
She doesn't have to run
off to Paris to do it.

430
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,459
Instead of
complaining about her,

431
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,161
you should be her champion.

432
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:24,729
She's not like Mama.

433
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,565
She's more independent and if
you do not treat her better,

434
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,568
you are going to lose her.

435
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:47,485
Kostas, what?

436
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,989
Javier told me
you were working here.

437
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,126
Why didn't you tell
me you were in town?

438
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:02,066
I've been busy.

439
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,668
Is it going well?

440
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,471
It is, actually, it's, um,

441
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:09,607
it's thrilling to work with
so many talented artists...

442
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:13,177
Well, sounds wonderful.

443
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,982
What are?

444
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,884
Oh, I thought we
could have some sangria.

445
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:21,953
And you know where
to find sangria in Paris?

446
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,188
No.

447
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:28,192
No, I know a place
with a Chablis I can afford.

448
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,998
Merci.

449
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:37,671
So, let me guess, you left him?

450
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,340
No, why would you say that?

451
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,978
Well, it's the only
way I could imagine Pablo

452
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,857
allowing the mother of his children

453
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,682
to run off to Paris without him.

454
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,251
I didn't give him a choice.

455
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,886
Good for you.

456
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,388
I do miss the children though.

457
00:30:56,389 --> 00:31:01,157
I finish work and I go
home to a quiet apartment.

458
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:03,995
If you're lonely,
you can always call me...

459
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:14,720
Well, we all know Pablo
does whatever Pablo wants.

460
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:18,376
Why can't you do the same?

461
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:27,518
Heraclitus said nothing remains still,

462
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:31,856
change is the essence of the universe.

463
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:37,629
All day on his knees,

464
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,897
before the rag so dirty
as it dribbles down.

465
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,670
Love seated in the
corner of the kitchen.

466
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,374
To amuse herself, she cuts her nails.

467
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,083
It's uh, bold.

468
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:03,554
Original, just like your paintings.

469
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:08,593
You are afraid
to tell me it's dreadful.

470
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:13,731
You see, I know I am an
amateur, but poetry...

471
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,603
Is the only way I can
express myself lately.

472
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:22,073
I, I haven't painted in-in months.

473
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:27,497
I, nothing moves me
anymore, not the light,

474
00:32:27,498 --> 00:32:29,614
not Marie-Thérèse, nothing.

475
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,317
You need something
new to inspire you.

476
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:34,119
Let me guess.

477
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,820
Another Amour Fou?

478
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,789
No.

479
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,732
Actually, I was thinking...

480
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:45,363
another artist.

481
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,812
Do you know Renoir?

482
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:50,209
Of course, but I have always

483
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,313
despised his pretty paintings.

484
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,771
Ah, not the father, the son.

485
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:58,607
Now, he's doing some
very interesting work.

486
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,947
Cut!

487
00:33:04,948 --> 00:33:07,750
Cutting, that's a cut.

488
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,810
Checking the gate, moving on.

489
00:33:10,811 --> 00:33:13,846
Let's print the
last two takes, please.

490
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:16,749
So this is how
Charlie Chaplin does it?

491
00:33:17,184 --> 00:33:18,318
Well, Chaplin's a genius...

492
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,014
- Ah.
- I can only hope.

493
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,303
Jean, is that, uh?

494
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:24,169
She's Dora Maar,
our set photographer.

495
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,519
Ah, you should meet
her, Pablo, she's fascinating.

496
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,920
Come, I'll introduce you.

497
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:29,455
Florelle is our lead actress.

498
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,791
Florelle, please meet Pablo Picasso.

499
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:33,293
Monsieur Picasso,

500
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:36,129
you're even more handsome
than your pictures.

501
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,613
And you are as ravishing
as you are in your films.

502
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:41,167
Even dressed as a laundress?

503
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:44,203
Especially
dressed as a laundress.

504
00:33:44,204 --> 00:33:47,106
Why don't you introduce
me to your friends?

505
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,347
That went well.

506
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:57,917
He's easily
distracted, like a child.

507
00:33:59,653 --> 00:34:02,288
I thought you said he was a God?

508
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:04,724
Ah, you'd think so
too if you got to know him.

509
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:06,125
I would have to meet him first.

510
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:10,163
And you will.
Just not today apparently.

511
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,566
Honestly, I can't understand

512
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,132
why you think we are so well-suited.

513
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,201
Because my dear
Dora, you are the two most

514
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:17,704
extraordinary people I know.

515
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:20,373
This is absurd, Paul.

516
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,308
Why don't you simply invite
us both to dinner instead of

517
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:24,811
contriving a "chance encounter"?

518
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,346
You know the rules of Amour Fou.

519
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:27,880
If it's arranged by you,

520
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:29,415
it's not exactly "fate" is it?

521
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:32,018
Ah, I'm just trying
to give fate a little push.

522
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,687
Well?

523
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:38,224
We've tried it your way.

524
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:41,160
Now, we are going to try mine.

525
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:57,777
What are you having?

526
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:00,413
Whatever you are.

527
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,582
Pernod.

528
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:05,584
Are you going to show
me your latest poems?

529
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:10,589
I've had a new idea.

530
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:14,127
No punctuation, and um...

531
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:15,361
What?

532
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,263
Reinventing painting wasn't enough?

533
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:20,433
Now you've got to...

534
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:39,786
You don't even flinch.

535
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:43,222
That is the point.

536
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:49,095
It's, uh, hypnotizing.

537
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:53,433
Dora! I didn't see you there.

538
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:57,069
Pablo, Dora Maar, the photographer.

539
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,572
Yes, I've, I've heard your name.

540
00:35:59,573 --> 00:36:01,307
A Surrealist, yes?

541
00:36:01,308 --> 00:36:03,509
You should see her work.

542
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,012
Intense, provocative...

543
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,949
Well, if it as
daring as she is, it must be.

544
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,284
Where did you learn that game?

545
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:12,852
Game?

546
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:15,121
This is quite serious.

547
00:36:15,122 --> 00:36:17,690
I could lose a finger.

548
00:36:17,691 --> 00:36:20,693
But one must
sacrifice for one's art.

549
00:36:20,694 --> 00:36:23,362
Very true.

550
00:36:23,363 --> 00:36:27,883
Perhaps you might be willing to
make a small sacrifice to my art.

551
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:33,339
What do you have in mind?

552
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,375
Come to my studio.

553
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:40,780
You have a most interesting face.

554
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:44,984
I want to photograph you.

555
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,492
I will agree to that.

556
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:55,628
But only if you allow
me to keep your gloves.

557
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,168
I would like a memento of the day
that fate put you in my path.

558
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:34,204
I have tried my
hand at photography but it's,

559
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,772
it's not for me.

560
00:37:35,773 --> 00:37:37,107
Oh, no?

561
00:37:37,108 --> 00:37:40,010
No, too unpredictable.

562
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:44,347
Not like painting where
the artist is in control.

563
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,284
Not a slave to the whims of the sun.

564
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:50,454
But the sun is similar to paint.

565
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,222
How is that?

566
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,639
At first you feel you must work

567
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,643
within its limitations, its quirks.

568
00:37:57,895 --> 00:38:02,999
But with practice, you learn to
use those to your advantage.

569
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,703
You feel what it wants from you.

570
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:13,009
But paint I can touch.

571
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:16,913
I can move with a brush...

572
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:19,716
or my fingertips...

573
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:22,753
Mm-hmm.

574
00:38:22,754 --> 00:38:26,256
But the sun surprises you.

575
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:29,125
Plays with you.

576
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,065
And film reveals
things that aren't uh...

577
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:40,670
obvious to the naked eye.

578
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:49,546
Maybe you would enjoy it a bit more...

579
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:53,149
if you gave up some of your control...

580
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:09,933
Françoise.

581
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:12,369
I wasn't sure you'd come.

582
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,404
Well, how
could I miss your debut?

583
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:17,073
I am your greatest champion.

584
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:32,422
Bravo!

585
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:41,297
Bravo, bravo.

586
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:52,743
How did you get back here?

587
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:56,446
I, uh, slipped
the doorman five francs.

588
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:59,750
Yeah, he should be more
careful because any scoundrel

589
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:02,285
could just sneak in here.

590
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:07,390
Your work is stunning, Françoise.

591
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:12,429
These are for you.

592
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,768
Thank you.

593
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:31,803
I'm, I'm so sorry, I have to
go, Pablo is waiting for me.

594
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,654
Well at least I
have one kiss to remember.

595
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,628
Oh, bravo.

596
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:48,465
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

597
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:51,434
I waited two months
for you to finish the ballet.

598
00:40:53,137 --> 00:40:56,539
I don't mind a few extra minutes.

599
00:40:57,842 --> 00:41:01,144
But it will be wonderful
to have you home again.

600
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,748
Yes, I'm excited
to see the children.

601
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:08,785
Now you can concentrate
on being a mother again.

602
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:21,331
Is that the only
reason you want me back home?

603
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:23,200
No, no, of course not.

604
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:25,902
I-I only meant that the
children have missed you.

605
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,704
And so have I.

606
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:31,575
So, you know, it has been
a change for all of us not

607
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:34,310
having Mama to look after us.

608
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:40,884
Well, change is the
essence of the universe, Pablo.

609
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,921
Françoise, where are you going?

610
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:17,287
No, keep them open.

611
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:20,290
Look at me.

612
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,610
What's wrong?

613
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:44,247
Nothing's wrong.

614
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:47,317
I, realized Paul was right.

615
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:56,226
He was right that I
have never been in love before.

616
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:27,190
Dora, I already have a studio.

617
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:29,592
Not like this.

618
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:53,683
This place is perfect for you.

619
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:59,622
A place to start something new.

620
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:06,426
To forget about Olga and dinner
jackets and stuffy cocktail parties.

621
00:44:10,835 --> 00:44:13,903
What do you think?

622
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:17,507
The light is good.

623
00:44:20,945 --> 00:44:23,046
Did you know this
building is the setting for

624
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:26,749
Balzac's story
Le Chef d'Oeuvre Inconnu?

625
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:32,221
The one where the protagonist
Frenhofer is striving...

626
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:36,826
Trying to paint
the perfect painting.

627
00:44:42,233 --> 00:44:45,068
You're right.

628
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:48,538
It would be perfect.

629
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:54,243
Dora, you know I cannot live with you.

630
00:44:54,912 --> 00:44:58,247
At least not right now.

631
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:11,227
Pablo, I could
never live with you.

632
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:14,297
You would drive me mad.

633
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:35,952
You have come to your senses.

634
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:43,626
Yes, I have.

635
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,032
I knew you would.

636
00:45:49,033 --> 00:45:51,968
No one understands you like I do.

637
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,143
Pablo, I'm leaving you.

638
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:02,945
Don't tell me.

639
00:46:04,315 --> 00:46:07,250
Now you want to do an opera.

640
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:15,825
I'm not joking.

641
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:23,366
I can't live with you anymore.

642
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:28,004
Is there someone else?

643
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:31,674
Kostas.

644
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,713
My, my nephew's friend?

645
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:39,382
Is that who you choose to replace me?

646
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:43,820
An he's an amateur philosopher?

647
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:48,724
The last thing I
need is a replacement for you.

648
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:55,582
I need to be free, to work
and live the way I want.

649
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:04,907
I need to learn how to be happy.

650
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:08,211
I have made some
arrangements for the children

651
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:11,781
to start school in September in Paris.

652
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:13,183
We'll be leaving then.

653
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:17,420
We both know that
you will never do that.

654
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,925
Without me, what will your life be?

655
00:47:27,398 --> 00:47:29,532
I don't know...

656
00:47:32,736 --> 00:47:36,405
but it will be my own.

657
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:40,310
Well, then you
will be known as the

658
00:47:40,311 --> 00:47:44,614
foolish woman who left Picasso.

659
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:54,290
Yep.

660
00:48:14,578 --> 00:48:17,847
She must be out of her mind.

661
00:48:17,848 --> 00:48:21,417
Those poor children being
kept from their father.

662
00:48:22,286 --> 00:48:26,972
Yeah, but I am sure
she won't go through with it.

663
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,328
Here are the
pieces you asked for.

664
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:36,732
I don't think
you've met my cousin Jacqueline.

665
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:42,338
No.

666
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:47,777
It's an honor, Monsieur Picasso.

667
00:48:47,778 --> 00:48:49,846
Jacqueline is very handy.

668
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:52,215
She has been a great help to me.

669
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:55,184
I'm sure she could help you, too...

670
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:59,155
if you do find yourself needing
someone to cook or clean.

671
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:02,158
Or anything else you may want.

672
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:11,701
Paloma, Paloma.

673
00:49:16,173 --> 00:49:18,241
I need mine, Mom...

674
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:22,278
All right, we'll
get it, we'll grab it after.

675
